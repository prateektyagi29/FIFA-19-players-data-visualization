# FIFA-19-players-data-visualization
FIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series.  It is the 26th installment in the FIFA series, and was released on 28 September 2018 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Microsoft Windows.  The game features the UEFA club competitions for the first time, including the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup as well. In June 2019, a free update added the FIFA Women's World Cup as a separate game mode.  This is the last game in the FIFA series to be available on a seventh-generation console, and the last known game to be available for the PlayStation 3 worldwide.
